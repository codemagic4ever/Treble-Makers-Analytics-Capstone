# Analytics-Capstone-Project
This project was developed as part of the course and focuses on building a music recommender system using a provided music database. Our team, The Treble Makers, implemented collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and a hybrid model that combines both techniques to enhance recommendation accuracy. We used Python and SQL.

The project includes:

**Collaborative Filtering:** This model recommends music based on user preferences.
**Content-Based Filtering:** This model suggests music by identifying similar items.
**Hybrid Recommender System:** This combines collaborative and content-based methods, leveraging strengths from both for a balanced recommendation approach.
